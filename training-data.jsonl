{"prompt": "At the vigil for Aboriginal schoolboy Cassius Turvy at Town Hall last night, Greens Senator David Schubridge said that he wished there were more people from federal parliament at the vigils listening and hearing powerful truths. Do you agree that there should have been greater attendance from politicians?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "I think that the thieving of Cassius' life is one of those moments I think where it makes all of us pause and wonder whether we are doing enough. I wasn't at the vigil this morning. I'm told that one of the frankly stunning moments about it was when Cassius' family were behaving with incredible grace given what they've been through. And so I think we should acknowledge that too. We should acknowledge that we've got a long way to go as a country still despite all the progress that we've made.

Why are they so unloved? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": "I mean, it's unacceptable if that's the case. Those lectures were, you know, characteristically thoughtful and impactful and powerful. And again, you know, we need to listen to the First Nations people of this country, not just listen but act. The Voice is a crucial part of that in my opinion, but not just that. There is so much more that we need to do and our government is committed to doing more. END"}
{"prompt": "With non-discrissionary items rising faster than CPI indexation, welfare recipients like myself are meant to be grateful for that rise. What essentials should I be cutting from my budget?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "This goes to what is the biggest challenge in our economy, in our communities and in our society right now, which is that the costs of living are going through the roof. And that has a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable amongst us and we understand that. The budget in October was about this challenge. And it had within it, as you I think are alluding to in your question, billions of dollars of extra payments which come from the automatic indexation. I'm not for a moment claiming credit for that, but that is an important feature and function of our budget that when inflation is growing as it is right now, then payments twice a year try to at least keep up with that. And I know that's not always enough. I know that's often not enough, but that's an important feature of the budget. Our responsibility to you, and to really the whole country is to try and take the right economic decisions at a national level in the context of all of this inflation to make sure that we're not making inflation worse. And if anything, we're investing in the sorts of things that make it easier for people. And in the context of a budget which has a trillion dollars of debt and it's in deficit as far as the eye can see, then we've got to try and work out how do we provide that cost of living relief in a responsible way. And by responsible, I mean, how do we provide money to people without making the inflation problem worse, which is really my major concern. And so we've got some cost of living relief in there for the cost of medicines, the cost of child care, paid parental leave, housing affordability, and we've got a policy to get wages growing again.

{"prompt": "In the budget, it is people who are indebted or people who are struggling, who are going to have to bear the burden of this war against inflation. When does this turn around for those people?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "The best thing that we can do is to try and address the root cause of this problem, which is the inflation and that's what the budget was about. In addition to that, and even in the context of a budget, which was quite restrained in its spending, still big investments in Medicare, still the indexation of those payments, doing what we can, what we responsibly can to make life a little bit easier for people. But I don't want to pretend that the budget fixes all of these challenges. And I do need to be upfront with all of you about the nature of this challenge that we are confronting right now. And we will do what we can. But we need to do what we can in the context of only promising what we can afford and try and work out what our best contribution to this problem is. And our best contribution to this is being restrained in our spending, giving some cost of living relief where it's responsible and investing in the sorts of things that will get us out of it. END"}
{"prompt": "According to Labour, inflation is public enemy number one. It is people on the front line of this who are going to feel the heat. Because anything that helps them fuels inflation, this is the bind you're in. Can you truly tell us where inflation will peak out? You projected at 7.75% in the budget, that's gone. The Reserve Bank is now talking about 8% international, it'll top 9%. You can't really sit here and tell people where this will top out. Can you?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Nobody has a perfect crystal ball. But the expectations of the Reserve Bank and the Treasury is that this inflation challenge will get a bit worse until the end of the year. The Reserve Bank themselves have said that they expect interest rates to go up a bit further. They take those decisions independently. We don't preempt or second guess those. But we take responsibility for our part in this as the country's government. For too long we've had people in government who pretend that they have nothing to do with it. We accept responsibility in the budgets that we put together. And the main thing we can do here, the worst thing that could happen for people around Australia is if we let this inflation get out of control and you summed it up really well, a moment ago. If you are not careful with your spending, if you are somehow ill disciplined, then we would have this inflation problem worse for longer. And that's what we're trying to avoid. END"}

A big reason for that, which doesn't make it any easier. But the main driver of that is the war in Ukraine, which is causing havoc with global energy markets and pushing up the price of electricity. Even though these pressures are coming out as from around the world, they are felt around the kitchen table. I do acknowledge that. The work that we are doing now in our government is to work out what kind of intervention we can make in the energy market so that the sorts of price rises that are expected that our forecast at the moment don't eventuate.

And it's difficult to kind of think out loud about these as some market sensitivity and some work that we're still doing to be upfront with you. But there are broadly three paths. The first paths is something in the tax area. The second part is the one that you just referred to, which is around subsidies, whether that to be to people or to companies. And thirdly, whether there's some kind of change in regulation, that can bring the price down. END"}
{"prompt": "You're not going to give people a cash handout to help them with their energy bills, are you?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "That would be unlikely, but we don't want to rule it out because if this situation continues to deteriorate over time, you want to have all of the options. But our preference is to do something with regulation. And the work that we're doing right now, is to see whether there's some kind of intervention that we can make. To keep these prices down. That's our preference. But we don't want to rule out subsidies or tax. It may be necessary down the track, but let's see if we can do something with regulation first. END"}
{"prompt": "When you're talking about regulation around energy prices, are you talking here about setting a price, about trying to put a lid on the price? And for that, you're going to have to be able to regulate that, hold some of the supply back from going overseas and cap it, aren't you?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "That is one of the options, is around price caps. And a lot of people have made those suggestions to us publicly that that would be one of the options. And that's obviously one thing that we're considering. It's not the only type of regulation, but it's one of the ones that's most commonly suggested to us. We have a little more work to do on this. And so I can't tell you tonight the final conclusion, but we know that electricity prices, that began rising before the election are continuing now and intensifying. END"}
{"prompt": "Increased prices of fossil fuels have generated massive windfall profits for companies in the energy sector, who are exploiting Australian resources and sending them overseas. Is the Albanese Labour Government open to a windfall profits tax to fund key programs and deliver electricity cost relief to Australian households?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "So as people are probably aware, there's a tax regime that applies to the gas companies called the PRRT. Petrol Resource Rent Tax. And when prices are high, we get a bit more of a return from the PRRT. But I do understand and I suspect from your question, that in the community there is an appetite for us to get a better return on our resources. I do understand that. We got about $200 million more this year from the PRRT because prices were high. And the company tax take went up a fair bit as well and that's related. Our preference when it comes to energy markets, at least in the near term, is to try and do something on regulation. There is work going on to see whether there's a more effective way to tax gas, to make sure that the PRRT is working as it should. But our first port of call, our priority, the thing that we're working on, is on some of these regulatory options. END"}

{"prompt": "Currently 3.3 million Australians live below the poverty line. Will the government commit to ending poverty or does it believe that poverty is acceptable?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "No, I don't think anyone can believe that poverty is acceptable. And if it was an easy challenge to address, we would have fixed it by now. You've got to chip away at a problem of that magnitude. I think housing is a big part of the story. And there are other ways that we can support families and people doing it tough. And as a Labour government, we are always looking for opportunities to do more. We don't want to ever give people false hope that you can just click your fingers and make poverty disappear. But you can commit to work away at alleviating it and eliminating it. And that's what we do. END"}
{"prompt": "Privilege is embedded. The richer getting richer, they're going to get richer even during an inflationary cycle. Because they're earning more on what they've got saved away and they're passing that on to their children. So, what point do we have to get serious about taxing inheritance, about looking at intergenerational wealth?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "We're not contemplating an inheritance tax or anything that looks like that. There are other ways to make the tax system fairer and to generate this kind of intergenerational mobility that we want to see. We made a start on that by taxing multinationals differently, tax compliance measures, some other measures in the budget. We need to continue to work away at that front. I think we can make this tax system fairer. I just don't want to give you the sense that we're going to act on that particular one because we're not. END"}
{"prompt": "The budget paints a pretty bleak outlook. Should we be prepared for a recession? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": "I don't think so. Certainly not the Treasury's expectation in their forecasts that we will go that way. But Europe will. UK will. Other countries are at risk as well. And we won't be completely immune from that when the global economy turns down substantially. As it did, you know, almost 15 years ago, as it did a couple of years ago, you know, we can't completely escape the consequences of that. But our expectation is that we will avoid a recession. Our economy will slow substantially next year, quite substantially, as a consequence of the global downturn, the impact of higher interest rates and some other issues as well. And so my view about the economy is I am really quite optimistic about the future of our economy and the future of our country. But over the next six or 12 or 18 months, we are in for some very tricky terrain from a global point of view, and we will feel the impact here. END"}

If your question is, can we make the tax system fairer? I think we can. I know that you're referring to a very specific tax change there, and you're probably aware that we haven't changed our view on that. But I do think we should be looking for ways to make the tax system fairer, and we should be doing that so that we can fund the things that our society values, like education and public health. END"}
{"prompt": "In the core of the Labour Party identity, you usually care for the low income and the poor and middle class. Why is this new government giving tax cuts and child care subsidies for people earning more than $300,000?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "A couple of things about that. On the early childhood education subsidies, on the cheaper child care policy, the reason that we don't cut it off at a low-ish income or a middle income is because we see early childhood education as part of the education system, not part of the social security system. And so, you know, state schools don't mean test kids in prep for grade one. And so we think that there's an important economic benefit to be had for the country. And important educational benefits for little kids, if they have access to early childhood education. And that's why we have never seen it. We haven't seen it in this policy as social security. We've seen it as a different kind of investment. And that's how we treat it differently. Now, in terms of the broader picture about what do we do for people on lower incomes? The very first thing that this government took to our cabinet was our support for a decent minimum wage rise. And that, was an early demonstration of a core labour value, which is that people on low incomes deserve a decent minimum wage so that they can try and keep up with the rising costs of living. And I think those sorts of decisions that we took then and other decisions that we've taken, keep faith with the core labour values that you're talking about. END"}
{"prompt": "The Paul Keating government of the 1990s saw the mortgage repayment rates go up to as high as 18%. With the inflation rate being almost identical as the 1990s and the ever increasing interest rates of the Reserve Bank of Australia, are we seeing a repeat of history? How will we control the inflation rates and what happens if it will reach 10%?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Nobody who follows interest rates in the markets or elsewhere is expecting anything like what we saw in the first half of the 90s. Absolutely nobody is expecting that. The budget itself assumes it follows what the Reserve Bank Governor has said about rates will go up a little bit more, but nobody is expecting the outcome you referred to. But again, interest rates are determined by what's happening with inflation. The whole reason why we delivered a budget which was so responsible, so restrained, invested in the drivers of growth with low inflation is because we understand that inflation is the biggest challenge that we have. And if we don't get on top of it, interest rates will be higher for longer and people will cop it in the neck. Our choice was, would we splash a lot of cash around and get good headlines in the media? And there'd be economic consequences for that. Or do we try and get the economics right and let the rest of it, let the political cards fall where they may. And the truth is, we've had to make difficult decisions. END"}
{"prompt": "To combat inflation in the simplest forms Australia needs to spend less. Would you consider increasing GST or similar the tax to cutale spending?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Don't intend to do that. Won't be increasing the GST. The Reserve Bank lifting interest rates is about trying to take some money out of the economy. Our job is more on the other side of the economy. How do we invest in making it grow faster without inflation getting out of control? And that's why dealing with labour shortages is a big part of our plan. Fee free TAFE, university places, our childcare policy. All of these things are about investing in people so that we can grow the economy more quickly without adding to inflation. It's our intention not to make this problem on the demand side of the economy worse. But we don't see tax changes as a way to pull more money out of the economy. That's largely the job of the Reserve Bank. END"}
{"prompt": "You have indicated, and you indicated in the budget, that there are big ticket items that are going to require a lot more revenue. You're going to have to look at the taxation mix at some point. NDIS, aged care, defence, a whole lot of things. At what point do you start to look at the tax mix? At what point do you look at things like capital gains tax, potentially on the family home, removing the 50% discount on capital gains on investment properties, when you look at things like negative gearing, and we know tax is the third rail, don't we? You touched that and it can be political death. But you're going to have to tackle that, aren't you, between now and when you go next, go to the polls?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "This country needs tax reform. We've made no secret of that. What we showed in the budget is that you need to move simultaneously on a number of fronts. You need to have spending restraint. And so we as a country got this surge in revenue from higher commodity prices. We let that flow through the budget rather than spend it. That's important. That's the key reason why there's less debt in our budget over the next four years than there was in my predecessor's budget. You need to trim spending. We found $22 billion worth of savings. The last budget had $0 in savings on the expenditure side. But tax reform has a role to play. We started last week with some multinational tax reforms, some reforms around compliance and a couple of other kind of medium sized measures. And I think in lots of ways, that's the template. When you are trying to get a budget on a more sustainable footing, so that you can pay for the NDIS, you can pay for health and aged care and good defense spending. And when you're conscious of the fact that the fastest growing area of spending in the budget is actually the interest costs on the debt that is already there. Then once you recognize all of that, then obviously every budget needs to consider and contemplate spending restraint, spending cuts and tax changes to make the budget more sustainable. END"}

And this is part of that. Our region is becoming a more difficult place to manage. It's why the foreign minister Penny Wong and defense minister Richard Marles have put so much effort into our near-neighbourhood in the Pacific. It's why we've signed under our predecessors the AUKUS deal. And that is because we do need to value these relationships, these alliances. Our region is becoming a more complex place to be part of. We support the status quo in our region. At the same time as we recognise that some of these pressures are intensifying. And so this decision is one that I support for all of those reasons. END"}

And what can a Labour government do to influence policy change to attract teachers back to the profession?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "To all of those teachers that you're referencing: we need you. We desperately need you. The minister for education Jason Claire has made an announcement about how we deal with the shortage of teachers. We understand the indispensable role that teachers play in our society for so many reasons. And we need to find ways to value teachers more, to retain them better. Many school principals have these amazing teachers come in and all the effort goes into retaining them. It's hard to retain teachers. They go to more lucrative positions or they retrain or they might go and have kids and then not come back. All of these challenges that the education minister is very attuned to.

And look, my preference, it would be to have an Australian or an Australian design. On there of some kind, the governor of the reserve bank has indicated it's a choice between the King or a design in his view. And I would rather see something Australian on the $5 note. It's not a decision that I take or certainly not a decision that I take alone. On the Republic front, absolutely. Absolutely. And the first thing that we need to do is a Voice to Parliament. When we achieve that together, then we need to move on to a republic. I cannot believe that a country like us in this day and age couldn't see itself with one of our own as our head of state.

{"prompt": "MediBank has decided not to pay a ransom despite hackers threatening and following through on the threat to release highly sensitive customer information, which includes abortion records and history of drug and alcohol abuse. Cybersecurity criminals are often from highly sophisticated, highly profitable networks of transnational criminals and rogue states. On the one hand, paying a ransom may encourage more attacks. On the other, not paying a ransom may result in millions of Australians' private information being released. How should government and businesses manage this dilemma when a cyber security hack has occurred?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Well, I think the operative word here is criminal, right? And there's no such thing as an honest criminal. So even paying the ransom doesn't necessarily guarantee that the data that they have is going to be released, whether it's on the black market, on the dark web, or elsewhere, that's the first thing. But I think that the other important point to make here is that cybercrime is going to get worse and worse and it's going to escalate and there will be new modes of it. I think organisations need to start seeing cyber security as part of their core business. And developing cyber safe cultures within their organisations as well. A lot of the time, a cyber breach is from the weakest link in the chain, which is the human link. Someone who has fallen for a phishing scam or some kind of scam within the organisation.

It has increased. Yes, absolutely. But that's what criminals do. They innovate and they are opportunistic.

And at least have done something and taken back. Most of them have. Most Western countries have. Fourthly, I want to really address this point about this trope about the ISIS brides. Because, if you ever met or heard the story of how some of them got there, they did not go willingly. Many were children when they went there, 15, 16-year-olds. Many went there because they were duped into going there. But regardless of how they got there or where they went there, if they are currently being assessed by our national security agencies as not being a threat, then they should be allowed back, number one, with facing all of the consequences that they will be facing for breaking the law as they have. But let me tell you something about radicalization. It doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens in an environment which is conducive to radicalization. You leave them there, they will become radicalised. And the next theatre of Jihad, they will be the fighters on the front line for the next theatre of Jihad and be more of a security risk. END"}

I mean simply by the fact that we're 50, more than 50% of the population, right? But I think that women's issues were more front and centre of elections and are becoming more front and centre of elections. Particularly, you know, in Australia, at the last election, there were certainly issues. Many of them were brought to light through the issues that happened within Parliament House and the treatment of women in Parliament House. But also we had the great, the women's march, and we were all told that we should be grateful that we weren't shot with bullets.

And these international summits, they're the pinnacle, I guess, of international affairs where world leaders meet, they interact in this rarefied atmosphere, really. And what they do and discuss really has an impact on shaping the world we live in. The Prime Minister in meeting President Xi was an important meeting because dialogue is good. But the important thing is, in the meeting, he was very clear that he would not resolve from Australia's national interests or our values, our democratic values, including human rights. And in the meeting itself, which, as I said, it hasn't happened for such a long time, it was important that he put forward Australia's interests around removing trade barriers, around human rights, which he did, around the detained Australians. And that's important. Now, that's up to the Chinese government to move the relationship forward. The ball's pretty much in their court. But the interesting thing about this is that Prime Minister Albanese has really practiced a nuance diplomacy. In the past, I've been critical of the previous government because there have been quite bellicose beating their chests, kind of scoring domestic political points. But the Prime Minister's engagement is important because it's about the world that we live in.

We need to be able to deter state actors, non-state actors from seeking to, you know, attack our interests in the region and diminish that rules-based order. The law of the sea, for example, is important for us as a trading nation. We need to have those naval capabilities to protect the sea lanes and have freedom of navigation. This all costs money.

And that doesn't always align with our partners or our allies. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. But the important point is that we are focused on what is important to us. And with respect to the U.S., I mean, you know, the previous administration, the Trump administration, there were concerns around some of the policies some of which weren't implemented, like wanting to, you know, leave the Korean Peninsula, which would have left a hole or, or, but things like, you know, diminishing the WTO and the rules around trade, which are important to us, you know, I was critical of that at the time. So we don't always agree with the U.S. And their system is decentralized. There's a lot of, in consistency and their voting, state-to-state, county to county, thankfully in Australia we have an independent electoral commission and we have compulsory voting, which is really, really important. It gives a resilience to our democracy that some others might not have. But every democracy is different. And I think the relationship of the U.S. is an important one. We welcome the Biden administration's commitment to the Indo-Pacific and to human rights and to a liberal rules-based order. And we're working very effectively with President Biden and his administration. But it's always about, it should always be about Australia's national interests first. END"}
{"prompt": "I actually lost everything in the floods this year. My home flooded three times. My question is, particularly as I'm still fighting with the insurance company to get anything back months later, should the government be doing more to help people who are losing everything in the floods? But in particular, the lower income brackets, you know, I come from the new demographic that's rising of the women who are single, 50s to 60s. I don't have enough money to see me through to my old age. And that's no fault of my own. It's just the way circumstances have been. But as older women, we are finding that we do have a voice and we do have a vote. And if you back us into a corner, we're going to come out fighting. And I'm not sure whether the government really want to test us out.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "It's obviously, it's devastating for you and so many other Australians to have, you know, towns like Forbes and other towns who've had floods and then more floods months later, to have to rebuild their lives, rebuild their properties, rebuild everything, to only have to go through it all over again. I'm not going to comment about the past. I will say that the Prime Minister we have now is committed to support for the people who have been devastated by the floods. In fact, the government has actually put for it a lot of financial assistance, $1,000 payments, one off payments, payments for financial hardship. The pain you're going through is traumatic and it's real. The people in Yugawa and Forbes, all those people who have gone through this again and again, absolutely understand how devastating it's been. I know you say you've got some payment. There are more payments being put forward. There are 500 ADF helping with a cleanup. There are more hardship and financial assistance for small businesses, for primary producers. The government is taking actions as much as it can to support the communities. And the other good thing is that the PM is actually working... You know, I'm from Melbourne, so we've got floods in Victoria as well in Northern Victoria. But, you know, the PM is working with Premiers, regardless of political affiliation. This is not about politics, he's not politicising it, he's working to find ways to help with the recovery. On your point about your vulnerability in that particular demographic, you're in absolutely. Because the highest number of the increase in homelessness is women over 55. And the Prime Minister and myself, and I think the housing minister, we all grew up in public housing, we're housos. We know how important having a roof over your head is to get a good start in life. He's committed $10 billion to public and social housing. He's allocated, you know, 30,000 new public houses, but allocated 5,000 houses specifically for women in those positions, because of that issue. That's a huge commitment that he's made and there's more that he's been announcing recently. END"}
{"prompt": "After two months of protest, Iranian people bravely responded with three days of nationwide strikes. Today is the third day. And millions of Iranian people are protesting right now to end the Islamic regime. We are witnessing a full-scale revolution. The Iranian regime has forced the national football team to sing the national anthem, at the World Cup, and not to act in any way that shows sympathy to Iranian demonstrators. Otherwise, they don't get paid and face charges. The shameful decision by Iranian regime to issue death sentence for protesters there has not scared the Iranian people but brought new blood into their vein to fight to the end. A baffling delay in acting for people of Iran when many countries have matched their words with action.

Do we have any news from such a decision by Australian government yet?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "I've spent years working with the Iranian diaspora community and refugees, spoke in parliament and support and in solidarity of the democracy protestors. The PM is still overseas. So obviously when he gets back, if he's had those meetings with the world leaders and there's a unified position, we'll find out. But we do have to stand up for those democracy activists, whether it's in Myanmar, whether it's in Iran, whether it's in Hong Kong, because that struggle, you know, at the very least as a democratic representative, I can stand in solidarity with those people who are standing and fighting for principles, fighting with their lives in many cases for those principles.

{"prompt": "The Prime Minister has been accused of bullying Michelle Landry in Parliament today. The Prime Minister said that his comments were aimed at Peter Dutton. This appears to be confirmed by Hansard. Does the panel consider that these comments were bullying, regardless of who the comments were aimed at? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Thanks, and thanks for the question. One, I work very closely with the Prime Minister. And so I know his character, and I know how he engages with people. And I can't for a moment think that he would have had any intention for his comments to be seen in any way shape or form as bullying. I think the second thing I would say is Parliament is quite theatrical. I think question time in particular is theatrical. There's an element of robust engagement. It's a different type of engagement that happens during that time. There's a lot of shouting. There's a lot of rhetoric. There's a lot of political arguments that go to and fro. And in a sense, you know, we sign up to that a little bit in politics. That part of the day. The third thing I'd say is we are implementing the Set the Standard report, which was a report done by Kate Jenkins into the last Parliament and we are looking at how we can improve conduct and behaviour across the Parliament as a whole. And I think there has been some significant change since the last Parliament. And we've got more work to do in that regard. But, you know, I think certainly from my point of view, having saying that I haven't seen the footage, but I can absolutely assure you. And I understand the Prime Minister has contacted Ms Landry to apologise at any offence that was caused, which is an appropriate thing to do from working closely with Anthony. You know, I just can't see in any way that that would have been any attempt to bully or intimidate anybody. END"}
{"prompt": "I believe the overwhelming reason people turned to the ALP was that the middle class and the poor were tired of the government kicking the cam down the road. Like it will be better this year or next year or the years to come. While corporate exorcists were rife, and people were going without. My question is, isn't this just a continuation under the new government of what we've had to put up with in the last 10 years? And where was the cost of living help that we needed on Tuesday night? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": "I don't agree that it's just the same as what's been happening in the past. This budget we tried to do three things. One was to deliver on our election commitments that we made before the last election, which we've done, was to provide sensible cost of living relief, where we could without adding to the inflation problem that we're dealing with, particularly in the first two years of these forward estimates. And the third thing was to do a spending audit, which I was in charge of, which was to find some savings in the budget to start working towards some budget repair, which we also need to deal with for good reason, in the sense that we've got a trillion dollars of debt, and managing that debt is the fastest growing program in the government budget. The difference that we're trying to deal with now, which is when we've looked at some of the global uncertainty in some of the downturns we've had in the past, particularly the GFC, the COVID-19 pandemic, the response from government, and it was right to have it, was around providing stimulus to households. What we're dealing with at the moment, in the short term, certainly in the first two years, is this inflation challenge. So what we've had to do is look at what's the responsible thing to do? We've got the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates to try and temper inflation, bring it back down. What is the responsible thing? Where can the government meaningfully help? The first decision we took was that we needed to support the work of the Reserve Bank, not make the inflation worse and make the Reserve Bank's job harder, in which case, so we looked at cost of living, where can we make a difference? We looked at things like childcare, things like PPL, things like investing in skills, things like getting on with the energy transformation. The worst thing the government could have done was indiscriminately splash around cash. Like, that is the worst thing. It's hard to say that because people are really feeling the pinch, and it's a different type of response that we've had to previous downturns, but we are dealing with a different set of problems, and the problem at the moment is inflation, and if we just chucked a whole lot of money out the door, we would add to that problem and make the problem worse, and that would hurt households further.

{"prompt": "Even before inflation, we already saw Medicare levies were at a higher threshold for older people. We saw, I believe, other forms of tax offset for older people. Older people are more likely to own their own home. They're more likely to own the investment properties that people my age are having to rent, and rents aren't being frozen or being, as Sonia pointed out, no extra assistance. So young people are feeling the pinch, and wage growth just isn't increasing in line with all that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "I think if you look at the budget, there is a map, actually one of the biggest increases in the budget going to your point was about $33 billion increase in payments, which does include payments for young people and for job seeker. So there was that adjustment and pretty significant adjustment at that. I think in other areas, I look at university places, I look at the investment in skills, I look at the housing accord. The first time, for a long time, that the Commonwealth has gone, you know what? We have a responsibility in housing, not just in signing off a deal with the states and territories on the housing and homelessness agreement, but actually being actively involved in affordable rental stock and coming to the table on that. Climate. I mean, there's 21 point, well, it's actually more than $21 billion in investments in the transformation that's happening across our economy right now to get moving with that. Young people have a huge stake in that. So I don't accept that this budget was framed with a particular demographic in mind. It wasn't. It was set against a very challenging set of economic circumstances, I accept that, which meant that we had to show restraint and be very considered in the decisions we've taken. But within that, we have massive investments in climate, in housing, in skills, in university, in schools. I mean, these are the areas the Commonwealth can invest in. END"}
{"prompt": "So people on youth allowance aren't getting any extra support to adjust the cost of living. And so they're not going to get any extra support with the rent assistance as well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Well, I think the decision we've taken, there is, the Commonwealth does provide support in rent assistance. We have a big increase in payments. We've got a big increase going out the door into community organisations to meet their costs. Many of those services are provided to young people in need. And then we have these other areas of the budget where we are making investments for the long term. I mean, we've inherited, like we've come into government, we've had five months. We've put together a budget, which was primarily around delivering election commitments, dealing with urgent and unforeseen things that happen, like Ukraine, COVID, floods, and cleaning up some of the legacy issues we were left by the previous government. So this budget should be seen as the first in a series of things. But we've had nine years of neglect that we're having to deal with here. END"}

I think we're not wanting to favour one over the other. I think when we're looking at things, if it's possible, and we have to work with the states and territories on this, because the states and territories have many of the levers. So it's not something that the Commonwealth can unilaterally do on its own. So discussions need to happen there. I think we would, you know, looking at what regulatory steps are available, is probably more where we would go in the first instance rather than cash hand out. END"}
{"prompt": "Are you going to change your position on Stage 3 tax cuts?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "The government hasn't changed its position on Stage 3. They come into effect in two years' time. I have to say in this budget, we have focused on the immediate pressing priorities of what's happening right now. I think if you look over the forward estimates, it really is these two years where we're dealing with the high inflation and some of the pressures that we're seeing now. This budget has been focused on the short term. What we've tried to do is to lay bare for everybody some honesty in government budgeting, because I don't think we've had that for some time. So we have shown very clearly what some of those pressures are. We've acknowledged there is the budget remains in structural deficit and will until we make some adjustments. Part of that conversation, sorry, has to be around all aspects of the budget. That includes revenue and spending. If anyone reads the budget papers, and I'll forgive you if you haven't, there's a lot of the books. But if you look over the medium term, the pressures are from spending on services that we all value aged care hospitals, the NDIS, defence, they're four of the top five growing programs. People value that, they want to see it, they want to see those investments. So we have to have a discussion about what we value and how we pay for it, and we are up for that discussion. END"}
